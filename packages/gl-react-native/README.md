========

`gl-react-native` is the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)  implementation of [gl-react](https://github.com/gre/gl-react), library to write and compose WebGL shaders.

**Important: STATUS: unfinished implementation**

> The current implementation of `gl-react-native` is experimental, based on exponent webgl wip implementation, and requires you to depend on latest Exponent.
Our goal is obviously to reach the same features of the previous gl-react-native version & the same features of the Web implementation.
