# Highest Priority

- Android Bug: each time I reopen my app from background OR more simply if I switch orientation of my phone, it starts "accumulating" renderings & blink like crazy... It looks like the way the gl calls are stacking over and over?
- Improve overall performance: Pretty bad in Simulator, not that great on device. in Release mode, it's much better, but I still feel it's not the best. Profile and investigate what's slow. Might be good to also have some way to measure things, show FPS. â€“ `animated` example needs to be as smooth as used to be gl-react-native v2. we're close.
- Bug: something is wrong on supporting many views at same time: `hearts` cookbook example renders black and make the app unresponsive. That example renders a list of GLViews, Not sure what happens. no crash tho. On Android it's working a bit better, but also crash after some scrolls.
- `colorscale` example breaks on iOS. it's not even crashing the app \o/ . works fine in Android.
- `demodesertcrt` example breaks too.
- Android: `paint` example does not work as expected. when you tap, the whole surface get colored! some issue with `discard;` ?! Same happen to the `pixeleditor`, everything gets paint, like if `discard` was not working?
- Android: `animated` renders black on first touch. (touch event issue in that example?)

# Medium Priority

- GLImages: implement unload and hook it to a LRU.
- improve DX: errors should appear clearly. things should be loggable (cookbook should have debug panel !)

# Low Priority

support things like View snapshotting, Webcam, Video,... These will go in independent features (I mean, after the initial release)
