- share codebase across the RN and the Expo app.
- the example align center but does not scroll?
- you should be able to swipe across examples.
- the list of example texts are shitty. we need to make it better. I think a thumbnail would be neat, simplify and cleanify the text too.
- implement blurimgtitle. probably will use react-native-view-shot for rasterizing the text.
- write more "pure tests" screens. accessible from the about screen.
  - add back the image orientations test
  - test if opacity "works"
  - try to put one surface in the corner of another to see if z-index and also if there is no rendering weirdness.
- implement a new example using EXGLView/Image and implementing https://threejs.org/examples/?q=pano#canvas_geometry_panorama_fisheye
