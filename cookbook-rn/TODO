- share codebase across the RN and the Exponent app.
- the example align center but does not scroll?
- you should be able to swipe across examples.
- the list of example texts are shitty. we need to make it better. I think a thumbnail would be neat, simplify and cleanify the text too.
- implement blurimgtitle. probably will use react-native-view-shot for rasterizing the text.
